# QuoteLibrairieDiscordBot
The goal of this discord bot is to allow user of server to manualy register quotes as value. So that they can display later as reminders or funny goofs.

Possible features in the future:
- A blacklist command for certain words that only mods could use
- A command to display all the titles
